# How to contribute
I'm really glad that you are interested in my project enough to contribute!
Thank you very much!

I welcome any kind of contributions and will do my best to help you along the way.
Just don't be shy and open an issue or create a pull request!
Any other GitHub communication channels are of course allowed.
If you are really shy, contacting me via e-mail is ok too.

There are no strict guidelines, so you should not worry about breaking any rules.

I'm open to dialog and I promise to behave responsibly and treat all contributors
with respect. Please try to do the same, and treat others the way you want to be
treated.

Thank you again!
