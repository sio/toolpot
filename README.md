# Package contents
### toolpot.scripting
Tools for day to day OS automation.

Unix shell is an incredibly powerful tool
and writing shell scripts can be very fun, but Python offers ease of use
and reuse far beyond what can be found in shell. Plus Python smoothes a lot of
edge cases (read: string escaping) that can be time consuming to do properly
in bash

### toolpot.linux
Linux administration tools.

### toolpot.python
Use these tools to simplify some repeating tasks when developing in Python

### toolpot.openshift
Some scripting tools specific to Red Hat's Openshift automation

### toolpot.sap
Helper utilites for SAP ERP users. No administrative access to SAP server is
required or assumed
